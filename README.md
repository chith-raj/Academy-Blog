# Academy Blog

## What is Academy Blog?
It is a blog website for the Freshworks Software Academy.

## Why is Academy Blog?
We can get updates from the academy. We'll be able to create our own blog and see,like, comment on others blogs too.

## Why I chose this project?
I wanted to make my project visible to all. Then I thought the next batch students will look through my website and get inspired by it. So I started doing this project for the academy.
